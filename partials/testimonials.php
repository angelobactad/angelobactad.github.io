                                BEST designer i have dealt with designing my logo. They actually listen to what you want and need. They use that information and create original content. If you want any changes the designer is happy to switch things up if need be. The designer communicated fast and helped me throughout the process. Even when i realized i didnt have the right programs to download the files. They also helped me with that as well.
